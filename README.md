# Text-Encrypter-Decrypter

This is a Text Encrypter/Decrypter program written in Python which uses the Caesar Cipher technique to encrypt the text.

The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
